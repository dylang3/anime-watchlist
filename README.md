# Anime Watchlist 

## Overview

The Anime Watchlist allows users to record animes they're currently watching, would like to watch, or have completed. The project draws its inspiration from [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf7ShkmaNNE) by [Tyler Potts](https://www.youtube.com/@TylerPotts). 

This is what I would argue is my first "real" web application that I am developing during the beginning stages of learning HTML/CSS/Javascript.

## Features

### In Development
* Responsive layout
* Functional buttons
* Add/subtract episodes watched
* Sort based on Completed, In-Progress, or Want to Watch

### Feature Wishlist
* Add section for animes On Hold
* Add drag-and-drop functionality using the [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)
* Add dropdown to select tier rating (e.g. S-tier, C-tier, etc.) -- this could be used to generate a tier-list using the anime name and image which would be pretty cool!
